# .github

Maybe `.github` is special repository that shows the readme for a Personal GitHub just like for GitHub Organization?

No, for Personal Github, the special repository must have the name of the GitHub user_name: [bestia-dev](https://github.com/bestia-dev/bestia-dev)
Pretty inconsistent!

And for a quasi personal website it has to be named like [[https://github.com/bestia-dev/bestia-dev.github.io]].

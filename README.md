# .github

Maybe `.github` is special repository that shows the `readme` for a Personal GitHub just like for GitHub Organization?

No, for Personal Github <https://github.com/bestia-dev>, the special repository for `readme` must have the name of the GitHub user_name: <https://github.com/bestia-dev/bestia-dev>.

Pretty inconsistent :-(

And for a quasi personal website <https://bestia-dev.github.io/> the reopsitory has to be named like <https://github.com/bestia-dev/bestia-dev.github.io>.
